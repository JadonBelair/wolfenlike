# Wolfenlike
a simple software-rendered raycasting engine made in rust using [Pixels](https://github.com/parasyte/pixels) and [Winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)

## Sources
I got all of the textures from [this Wolfenstein 3D texture library](https://www.areyep.com/RIPandMCS-TextureLibrary.html)
